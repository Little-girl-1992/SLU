I have a couple of choices in Essen. Are you looking for a 2-star or a 3-star option?
>>>> request_hotel_category

The three star option
>>>> inform_hotel_category
34
wizard
Your best choice would be the Relaxation Hotel which is a 3-star hotel and includes breakfast and wifi. It is available either from August 15th to August 27 or from August 27th to September 2nd. Do either one of those dates fit into your schedule?

I have several that suit your dates.. Your stay would be at the Una casa which is a 3-star hotel and includes free breakfast, wifi and parking, should you wish to rent a car and explore the surrounding areas. The flight departs on August 15th and returns on the 20th.

The package to Santiago is $2455.37 as opposed to the package to Essen which would be $3016.94. Please keep in mind that the trip to Essen is a longer trip though.

Are you interested in the 2-star option or the 3-star option?
>>>> request_hotel_category

the 3 star hotel seems to be the best how much would it be to book a business class flight?

If you are looking for a business class flight, I only have one package that has the availability. It would be at the Motel Ivory which is the 2-star hotel and is only available from August 26 to September 1st. The total price for that package is $3314.99.

At the 2-star Motel Ivory Safari, for your original departure date of August 15 it is $3016.94. At the 3-star Relaxation Hotel, it is $3073.16. Is Essen your final choice for the destination?

Hey! You can help me by finding a trip to Philadelphia from Maceio.
>>>> greeting inform_citys
35

In Philadelphia you can stay at a 2.5 star hotel for 11 days. As for Fukuoka, 11 days at a 2.5 star hotel would cost 4719.74USD. I can offer 14 days in Essen for 3787.14USD; this would be at a 2.0 star hotel. 4 days at a 2.0 star hotel in San Antonio would cost 2311.48USD.
