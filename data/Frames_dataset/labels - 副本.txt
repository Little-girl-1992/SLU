I have the Muse available for 12 days but that is only a 2 star hotel.  However, I do have some suggestions. I have some excellent options available during that time period. A nice 4 star hotel in Calgary, Canada, another nice 4 star hotel in Marseille or a 4.5 star hotel in Frankfurt, Germany all with direct flights from Portland. Do any of these cities interest you?

It's a bit higher than your budget at $1849.57USD.  The trip to Birmingham was $1242.70USD so that was closer to your budget and that is in a 4 star property.

100

I would be leaving from Sydney and I have to be back by Wednesday, September 7.  I'm so excited!
>>>>
100
wizard
Do you have any destinations in mind?
>>>>
100
user
Not really. As long as it is within those dates, or even returning a bit earlier,  and also within my budget, I really don't care where I go. I am just happy to get out of Sydney for a while.
>>>>
100
wizard
Great! I'll see what I can do. What is your budget for this trip?
>>>>
100

I just got my big yearly bonus so I have $6100.00 to spend. Send me as far away as possible!

>>>>
100
user
What else is included in that package?

100

Free breakfast and free wifi. It is well within your budget at 4018.16 USD. Would you like me to search packages in the 5000 USD range?
>>>>
100
user
No, but can you please give me some flight details on it? I don't like flying out too early in the morning! Also, would I be flying economy or business class?
>>>>
100

Departure from Sydney is at 12:00pm, arrival in Berlin is at 8:37pm. For the return flight, you would depart Berlin at 3:00am and land in Sydney at 11:37am. This is a business class flight.
>>>>
100
user
3:00am flight out of Berlin? No way! That means I will have to be at the airport at like midnight! What are the dates for the 8 day package to Brazil? Are the flights any better on that one? And how much is that package?
>>>>
100
wizard
The Brazil package is from August 26th to September 1st at a total of 4006.85 USD. Unfortunately, all return flights to Sydney leave at 3:00 am.
>>>>
100
user
Is it a business class flight also? Do I get a free breakfast and wifi with that one?
>>>>
100
wizard
The flight is business class and breakfast, wifi and parking are all included in your stay at this 3 star hotel. Can I interest you in a 4 star hotel in Brazil for 5003.33USD and a 8.8/10 guest rating?
>>>>
100
user
Hmmmm that one could be interesting too. A 4 star would be much better. I don't trust 3 star hotels, they are full of cockroaches! Are the dates and flights the same on that package?
>>>>
100
wizard
They are similar. Departure from Sydney is on August 27 at 11:00am and the return flight is on September 3rd at 3:00am. Breakfast, wifi and parking are all included.
>>>>
100
user
Do you have a flight that departs closer to August 22nd by any chance?
>>>>
100
wizard
The closest I have is the 3 star 8 day package to Manaus we spoke of earlier. The flight is on August 26th.

How much is the the 4 star rated hotel to Brazil? Was that one on a business class flight also?

100

The 4 star package to Campinas, Brazil is 5003.33 USD, this includes business class flights.

Actually there is only a 2.5 star  hotel

You don't understand, it is extremely important that I get to ,Atlanta from London on August 25, or even a little earlier and I need to look at anything you have available that is at least a 4 star rating. No celebrity would stay at a 3 star hotel. The 30th is too late.

How about a little later? The highest rated hotel is 3.5 stars does that work? I have one that departs on the 26th

167

Will you be travelling alone or with a companion?

167

All alone, and for the first time! If I wasn't so excited, I would be really nervous.

167

Do you need to stay in Monterrey right until the 15th of September?
>>>>
167
user
My dates are kinda flexible, but I absolute cannot go over a budget of 3100 dollars.
>>>>
167
wizard
Is a five day package in Monterrey acceptable for you? I have a flight departing on Aug 27 and returning on Aug 30 at the Oriental Peaks Hotel. It is a little bit more than what your budget allows for at 3240.72USD but it is a 4-star resort with an excellent client rating and it includes free breakfast, free wifi and free parking.
>>>>
167
user
Hmmm it's a little bit too expensive... they have another location in Kingston, can we see what's available there?
>>>>
167
wizard
I have a lot available in Kingston within your travel dates. Are there any special amenities you are looking for at the hotel?
>>>>
167
user
Hmmm well this is the first time I book any kind of vacation... Can you tell me what amenities are usually offered?
>>>>
167
wizard
In Kingston, I have hotels available from a 2.5 rated hotel to a 4 star hotel. I also have some hotels that are located near the museum for when you have some leisure time.
>>>>
167
user
Wow I'd love to spend some time near the Museum, is this one within my budget?
>>>>
167
wizard
All are within your budget. I can recommend the Golden Excalibur which is available from Aug 27 to Aug 30, is rated 3.5 stars and includes wifi and breakfast.
>>>>
167
user
Well that one sounds very nice. Can you give me the name of the hotel near the Museum? I'd like to compare the two hotels with my mom.
>>>>
167
wizard
This one is located right beside the museum. I also have the at the Raven which is a 3 star and the Ebony Manor Inn & Suites which is a 4 star located near the museum.
>>>>
167

Great! I'll talk about it with my mom and get back to you tomorrow. Thanks so much for your help!!

313
wizard
St. Louis and Columbus are the only places available that are on the beach at the moment.

Oh no! What if the end date was flexible? It's less ideal but we could be back as late as September 14th if that gives us better options. And we don't need to leave exactly August 27th, as long as the trip is about a week long.

Greetings, my name is Harold. My grandson told me that I can book a flight by talking to a robot over the World Wide Web - I could hardly believe my ears! Back in my day, you had to saunter over to the local travel agency and wait in line to talk to an agent.
>>>>
322
wizard
How can I help you?

322

Anyway, I am getting off topic here. If you could be so kind, I would like to inquire about possible flights departing from Lima and arriving in Mexico City

Hiiii! I was just selected for an internship and I could do it in 3 different cities. Since I'm on a budget I'll go to the city that best fits in my budget. The first one is Porto Aleger. Do you have any packages from August 27th to September 5th?

324

My shortest package in Porto time wise is 13 days. Is that too long?
>>>>
324
user
As long as I'm in Porto for the dates I gave you,  a longer stay is fine as long as the trip is in my budget! Actually, it could be kind of fun to stay longer, I would have time to do some sight seeing as well :slightly_smiling_face:
>>>>
324

I have a flight departing from Monterrey to Porto on August 27 and returning on Sept 8th. The price on that one is $3072. It is a 3.5 star hotel close to the University.

324

There are no available flights from Monterrey to Brasilia. Would you like to look at package number one again, the one to Porto? That package seemed to suit your dates and budget.

324

Yup! That one definitely seemed to suit my needs best! Give me a minute to read over the info again and I'll see if I have any other questions. oh yes! I will probably need to get some work done at the hotel, is there free wifi included?
>>>>
324
wizard
Not only is there free wifi, breakfast is also included in this package. Would you like me to go ahead and book this for you?
>>>>
324

I have a luxury package to offer you:  A  six day stay at the Regal Bluff, a 5 star hotel close to a university. You could even fly there in business class for 1752.90USD and still be way under your budget. The dates of this package are from September 6th to 11th. Do those work for you?

We were hoping for a longer vacation! That one sounds very nice and luxurious but let's check out beautiful Paris?

Absolutely.  Where would you be departing from and what cities would you like me to check for packages?

For Leon,  the longest package I have available is a nine day package from August 31 to Sept 8. The package that most suits your dates is the package in Detroit.

An extra day should be ok. For how many people is that price?

Me, my wife Penny and Johnny my son.

Fantastic. And could you tell me what your budget is?
>>>>
443
user
1700, I wish I could spend more but I'm a writer and my last book was a total flop you know. I'm travelling to work on my book so if you could find places that were calm that would be really nice. I need this one to be a masterpiece!
>>>>
443
wizard
Ok! Well sadly I cannot find you a package in Chicago for that budget, so perhaps you could tell me your other destination possibility and we can explore your options there.
>>>>
443
user
Ok, the other place I was thinking of is Baltimore
>>>>
443
wizard
For just a little more than your budget I can book you 13 days at the Countryside Inn. This would cost 1747.67USD for the three of you and you would be in Baltimore from Sept 2-14.

You could spend 8 days at the Countryside Resort in Baltimore for 1805.69USD.
>>>>
443
user
Ok well I really need this getaway so I suppose an extra 50$ and 3 days won't hurt. Can you tell me more about the place?

Yes, we have a wide stretch of possible vacation days from September 13th until October 3rd

For one adult, 3558.40USD for business class, and 2794.59USD for economy class.
>>>>
673
user
Two adults, one child. I thought I made it clear before that there would be three of us.
>>>>
673
wizard
Unfortunately, I do not have trips to Mexico City for this parameter which fits under this budget. Would you like to consider leaving some guests behind, or searching for an alternate destination?
>>>>
673
user
I absolutely would not leave my family behind... a little ridiculous for you to suggest that.. However, I would consider going to Paris
>>>>
673

Unfortunately, we do not have a trip to Paris for the given parameters.

673

Not if we travel for 8 days either?

Burlington to Toronto for 1 adult and 3 children.  I have several options.  Would you prefer to stay in Toronto for 8 or 12 days?
>>>>
789
user
I would prefer a longer trip, please! However, it behooves me to make mention of my 3300 budget for this voyage.
>>>>
789
wizard
Most everything I have in Toronto for September is under your $3300 dollar budget. For a 12 day stay, the Hotel Eric Perrier is priced at $2441.0USD and has a 4 star rating. It also has an excellent guest rating of  8.8 / 10.
>>>>
789
user
I would like to know if this hotel offers any amenities?
>>>>
789
wizard
Daily breakfast is part of the package, as well as wifi. If you wanted to travel by business class with the children, the price would be 2863.7USD, still below your budget.
>>>>
789
user
Can you also be so kind as to check for tickets to Philadelphia?
>>>>
789
wizard
I have one package available in Philadelphia, but unlike Toronto, I only have a 5 day package.  The Mirror Inn is priced at 2498.21USD and has a 2 star rating. The guest rating on this hotel is 6.61/10
>>>>
789
user
Understood. I would like to submit an application for the Toronto package, for the economy seat option. But before I do, can you remind me of the dates?

789
wizard
You would depart Burlington on September 8th at 11am and return on September 19 at 3am.

789
user
The return flight is past the children's bedtime. Do you have any other selections?

789

That is the only flight available from Burlington to Toronto on that day.

And have you got any time constraints for your vacation? Is there a date you would like to leave? A date you need to return home by?
>>>>
791
user
We can leave any day on or after September 2. But we have to get back before September 12
>>>>
791
wizard
Sadly I can’t find anything from Toluca to Porto for one man and one child that costs less than 3200 dollars… would there perhaps be an alternate destination in mind? Or maybe a higher budget you would be willing to work with?
>>>>
791
user
I was actually thinking of Toronto...
>>>>
791
wizard
Ok! You’re in luck - I have ONE package left to Toronto within your parameters, and I think it sounds perfect for you! You would depart on September 2nd, and leave Toronto on the eleventh. You’d be staying at the 4 star Hotel Eric Perrier, located near a cathedral and just a few short strides from the airport. You would be treated to free breakfast throughout your stay and have access to free wifi for the duration of your trip. The guest rating is an impressive 8.8/10 and the cost of the package is well within your budget at $2648.63.
>>>>
791
user
And we'll have economy seats I assume?
>>>>
791
wizard
Yes, that’s correct.

791

Well, I guess this Toronto package ain't too bad...

wizard
That would be the Royal Island Inn, close to the market and the palace. The accommodations are 3 star and wifi is provided free of charge.
>>>>
793
user
what do other guests think of this place?

793
wizard
The guest rating is 0/10, but that may just mean that the hotel has not been reviewed by guests yet.

I need a vacation. A real vacation. My boss finally allowed me to take time off between September 8 and September 14. The heat in Valencia has been awful this summer.

884

San Juan. I heard it's cooler there.

884

Yes, you’ve got it. Enjoy your stay.
>>>>
885
user
Hey man.  Sick of having my picture taken. Need somewhere quiet and away from everyone. Tijuana is probably a town no one wants to go to. Can you get me a ticket there?
>>>>
885
wizard
Sure! Leaving from where?
>>>>
885
user
London, England. Way too much paparazzi here. It's like a wolf den.
>>>>
885
wizard
I have 11 days at a 2.5 hotel near a park for 1290.36USD in Tijuana, Mexico. This package departs from London, Canada.
>>>>
885
user
Is it a 5 star? I'm travelling with my diva friend and she won't settle for anything but the absolute best. Find us a spa or something.
>>>>
885
wizard
As I said, this hotel is 2.5 stars. There is also the Resort Jade Covert available with a 3.0 star rating.
>>>>
885
user
5 stars only for my girlfriend and I.
>>>>
885
wizard
There are no 5 star hotels in Tijuana that I can find for you.
>>>>
885
user
Burlington then. 5 stars only.
>>>>
885
wizard
Once again I have only 2.5-3 star hotels.
>>>>
885
user
That just won't do. What if I leave from Denver instead? Anything better in Tijuana?
>>>>
885
wizard
Still just 2.5 or 3 star hotels, sadly.
>>>>
885
user
In Burlington?
>>>>
885
wizard
Below 3 stars.
>>>>
885
user
You know, I'm just gonna have my assistant take care of this, she'll get me a beautiful retreat with a spa and guards to keep the paparazzi away.  Good riddance, whatever the hell your name is!

885
wizard
Goodbye!

886

No budget! Find me something snazzy
>>>>
886
wizard
Well, we have a trip to Leon, Tijuana, Rosario, Maceio, and Punta Cana!
>>>>
886
user
What kind of hotel in Leon!
>>>>
886
wizard
It is a 5 star hotel near a market
>>>>
886
user
what are the amenities?
>>>>
886
wizard
A spa!
>>>>
886
user
What are the dates for this package?
>>>>
886
wizard
September 24th to October 4th.
>>>>
886
user
Would you be able to offer free breakfast to enjoy by the spa?
>>>>
886
wizard
Unfortunately the hotel does not accommodate for free breakfast
>>>>
886
user
how much would i be paying then, if breakfast isn't even included
>>>>
886
wizard
2153.39 for economy class flights or 2729.19 for business class flights
>>>>
886
user
I see. Can you check if there's a good hotel in Tijuana as well?
Priority goes to the ones that offer free breakfast!
>>>>
886
wizard
This has a 2.5 star hotel near a park, 6.77/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, from September 18th to 28th. The business class package is 1542.79 and the economy class package is 1229.30.
>>>>
886
user
Free breakfast is a big plus, but I'm a little iffy on the stars. Whats on offer in Rosario?
>>>>
886
wizard
I think you will like this one. It is a 4 star hotel close to shopping hot spots, 8.86/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 18th to 28th also, business class package comes to 3104.39, and the economy package comes to 2418.78.
>>>>
886
user
You're right! Its quite ideal. I've already been to Punta Cana so that's not a destination I'd consider, but can you just quickly check Maceio for similarly attractive hotels?
>>>>
886
wizard
This is a 3.5 star hotel close to a park, market, and theatre, 8.8/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 17th to 27th, business package costing 3680.67, and economy package costing 2868.83.

886
wizard
Would you like to book for business class or economy?
>>>>
886
user
In fact, I think I'm ready to book
>>>>
886
wizard
Business or economy?

886
user
Economy please

886
wizard
Great! Your flights are booked and you will get an email confirming your bookings! Have a great day and thank you for booking!

887
user
My place just burnt down and I need to get home immediately!
>>>>
887
wizard
I am very sorry to hear that. Where are you leaving from? Where would you like to go?
>>>>
887
user
I've been backpacking around the world for 3 months and now I'm in Vitoria.
>>>>
887
wizard
Where do you need to get to?
>>>>
887
user
Mexico City. I need to leave on or after September 16.
>>>>
887
wizard
ok! Have you got a travel budget?
>>>>
887
user
I got $3000 left to my name, that's why it's crucial I get home and deal with the insurance company!
>>>>
887
wizard
The only result I’m getting is a 15 day package to Mexico City for 2504.13USD. You would leave on September 20th. Is that ok?
>>>>
887
user
I guess that would work. Nothing sooner?
>>>>
887
wizard
Sorry - that’s the best I can do.
>>>>
887
user
What if I leave from Rio de Janeiro instead?
>>>>
887
wizard
The soonest I can get you out of Rio de Janeiro is also the 20th of September.
>>>>
887
user
What if I leave from Vitoria and go to Cancun instead?
>>>>
887
wizard
Once again, I have trips only on September 20th.
>>>>
887
user
And from Rio de Janeiro to Cancun?
>>>>
887
wizard
September 20th or 21st.
>>>>
887
user
The original 15 day package to Mexico City, what hotel is it at?
>>>>
887
wizard
Hotel Tropic, a 3 star hotel on the beach.
>>>>
887
user
Well I guess I'll  take it, the insurance should reimburse me and 15 days gives me enough time to find another home.
>>>>
887
wizard
I’ll go ahead and book that for you :slightly_smiling_face:
>>>>
887
user
Thank you!
>>>>
888
user

889
wizard
Sure can! You can go for as long as 11 days.
>>>>
889
user
Would it be at an upscale hotel?
>>>>
889
wizard
I wouldn't say so. It's a 2 star hotel, although it has 6.61/10 average client rating.
>>>>
889
user
Alright. Lets try another place: Kocchi
>>>>
889
wizard
That's not a bad choice! With your money you can stay 8 days at a 3.5 star hotel and 12 days at a 2.5 star hotel.
>>>>
889
user
Is the 3.5 star hotel near anything of note?
>>>>
889
wizard
Are you kidding? It's in the heart of the city and next to a park!
>>>>
889
user
Why would I be kidding? I did not expect to come here and get insulted by a bot. ok you know what
indianapolis also seems like it’d be cool
>>>>
889
wizard
It is very cool! With you budget you can go there for 10 days in a 2.5 star hotel.
>>>>
889
user
2.5 stars? how are the guest ratings then?
>>>>
889
wizard
Not bad. It's rated 6.37/10 on average.
>>>>
889
user
Thats it for today, thank you
>>>>
889

Alrighty, our best vacation package is at a 3.5 star beachside hotel. In the past, guests have rated it 8.22/10. While there, you can enjoy access to free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. We offer a 8 day stay there with business flights available. If you are interested, we also have a few 3 star hotels available.

1036

You don't have any hotels with 4 stars? And only 8 days? I prefer something longer!

The 3.5 star hotel is the best available in Curitiba. And we do offer trips up to 14 days. However, they will be at 3 star hotels. Are you interested?

Sydney is looking better! I've got a 4.0 star hotel with 8.86/10 guest rating. I can take you there for 6 days on business flights.

I think Curitiba must be better then.

1036

I agree. Would you like to further explore some of the options in Curitiba?

I think I'll take the beachside hotel deal for 8 days if that's the best there is.

>>>>
1045
user
Oh wow they all sound so good. Which ones are the most affordable?

1045

The options I have previously presented are the longest and best trips that make the most of your budget. However, shorter trips would be more affordable. Would you like me to find the most affordable trips for you instead?
>>>>
1045
user
Oh I'll see what the longest and best trips are! Please tell me about them. Let's start with San Diego!

Maybe Santos, La Paz, or Sao Paulo might interest you. Of course I can run searches for shorter trips and perhaps get a few more available cities if you would like.

Let's try La Paz!

The Cosmos Inn in Kingston is  1225.8USD for a 7 day stay, so about half the price.

I overlooked another option that you can afford which is the economy flights version of this package that costs 12919.26. The other hotel which is the cheapest Mexico City package is a 3 star hotel near the beach, shopping, and mall. The hotel has a 6.91/10 guest rating and offers free parking and wifi. This package is only available for economy flights and is from September 7th to 12th.

It's been done before, so don't pretend that you don't have flights from Kabul to St. Louis. It's really important for me to get there.

1124
wizard
There are no flights from St. Louis to Kabul. Can I look into another destination for you?
>>>>
1124
user
Yeah, I figured. I can't believe you guys got rid of it. Is this a question of money? If I offered you more money, then would a trip from St. Louis to Kabul suddenly present itself?
>>>>
1124
wizard
Sadly we do not offer flights to Kabul from St. Louis. Where else can I look for you?
>>>>
1124
user
So if I raised my budget by a few hundred dollars, then would you have a package to Kabul for me?

1126
user

1128
user
I hear Toronto is a good city.
>>>>
1128
wizard
Unfortunately I am only seeing trips for one hotel in Toronto and it is not near a park. I am limited in the amount of results I can fetch; if you could suggest a departure city it would be very helpful to narrow down the selection.
>>>>
1128
user
In that case, I'll try Belo Horizonte again. At least I can take the dog to the beach. What's the most highly rated hotel you have in Belo Horizonte?

Hello. Oh my next destination is my home.. as soon as I get off work
If I ever get off ....
But you know where I would really love to go?
Somewhere with sun.. anywhere really
Cleveland is so grey and dead this time of year
I've been dreaming of going down to South America
Would I ever be able to get to Campinas from here with 5200 dollars?
>>>>
1149

Sure can! You can go for up to 14 days to a 3.5 star hotel in the heart of Campinas, close to the mall and cathedral.

>>>>
1149

Impressive!! Now, I may be being greedy here..
If I was to keep my sunshine spree domestic
And went to Atlanta..
I'm wondering if I could be under budget enough that I'd have enough left over for maybe another trip
>>>>
1149
wizard
That is actually very possible. For a 10 day stay in a 3.5 star beachside hotel, it will just be 1283.2 in business class and 962.67 in economy class.

>>>>
1151
user

>>>>
1151
wizard
So would that just be two adults then? And is there a budget?
>>>>
1151
user
Yes my mom and dad. I have $5700 in savings. It has to be something romantic coz I'm giving it to them as an "anniversary" gift.
>>>>
1151
wizard
I found an excellent 18 day package at a 3 star hotel by the beach in Atlanta, US, costing a grand total of 4889.80. Would you be interested in booking this trip?
>>>>
1151
user
3 star?!? They'll never go for it....they like luxury. Got anything that's like a 5 star?!
>>>>
1151
wizard
The closest thing I have is a 15 day package to Rosario with a 4 star hotel. They can fly with business class, costing at a total of 2624.13. Would you be interested in booking this?
>>>>
1151
user
How about something on the beach? My mom likes to suntan.
>>>>
1151
wizard
I'm afraid of all the options I have, there is no hotel by the beach that is above 3 stars. Would you be interested in booking a 3 star hotel by the beach?
>>>>
1151
user
The 4 star hotel in Rosario, what's that one like?
>>>>
1151
wizard
The hotel has a rating of 8.86 out of 10 and you can do some great shopping in the area. Breakfast and wifi is included with the package, and it departs on Friday September 23rd, returning to Salvador on Friday October 7th.
>>>>
1151
user
k the 23rd should be good...enough time to prepare for the competition. I don't want to spend all my savings though...they don't need to fly on business class that;s for rich people. Whats it cost on economy?
>>>>
1151
wizard
The package with economy class would cost a total of 2204.67 USD.  Would you like me to book this package to Rosario for you?
>>>>
1151
user
YES!!!! Lets get them outta town!
>>>>
1151

Perfect. The booking is complete.

NO. I would like to see what else you have. Do you have any other hotels or are you giving me just one choice?

1158
wizard
I'm afraid we only have two packages available for what you're looking for, and they're both with the same hotel. Would you be interested in booking one of these packages?

1158

Can you stop asking me that please! We take one vacation every 3 years and I need to look at all my options! If I increase my budget to $5800, what can you offer us?
>>>>
1158
wizard
I am afraid that increasing your budget will leave you with the same options, with the 3 star hotel. Is there another destination you would like me to search for you?
>>>>
1158
user
It's nice that you are meeting my budget but I really need to look at more than just one 3 star hotel in Phoenix. I will shop around and get back to you if I can't find something better. Have a nice day.

>>>>
1160
user
